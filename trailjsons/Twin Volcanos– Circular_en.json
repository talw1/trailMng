    "description": "Circular Running Trail – Merom Golan, Mount Bental & Mount Avital\nThis circular running trail begins at Kibbutz Merom Golan and connects to the Golan Trail (marked in green, blue, and white), coming from the direction of the Bental water reservoir. The trail passes through volcanic landscapes and offers impressive viewpoints.\n\nThe route starts with a climb up Mount Bental – a striking volcanic cone. The ascent reaches halfway up the mountain, where a scenic northern view opens up toward Mount Hermon and the Valley of Tears.\n\nContinuing north along the Golan Trail, the Syrian city of Quneitra is visible to the east, along with a wide view of the border area. Further along, Mount Avital – the taller of the two cones – comes into view. To the east lies the Kaldara Valley, an agricultural area with orchards, and to its north, the slope of Avital’s crater.\n\nThe trail circles Mount Avital, offering views of the Syrian volcanic cone line across the border. Kibbutz Ein Zivan appears to the south (just below Avital), and additional cones – the prominent and nearby ones being Shifon and Yosefon – stand out in the landscape.\n\nToward the end of the loop, on the western side of Avital, Kibbutz Ortal comes into view, along with an open panorama westward toward the Upper Galilee and the Ramim Ridge.\n\nThe trail continues downhill on a paved road, separating from the Golan Trail which continues south. The route turns toward the Kaldara, climbs again toward Bental, reconnects with the Golan Trail, and returns to the starting point at Merom Golan.",
