    "description": "This coastal trail follows one of Israel’s most scenic shoreline stretches, combining sections of the Israel National Trail and the Sea Trail. The route can be run as an out-and-back from several access points—Tel Dor, Ma’agan Michael, Nachsholim, or Caesarea Aqueduct Beach—but here it is described as a one-way run.\n\nStarting at Caesarea Aqueduct Beach, the trail heads north along the Mediterranean shoreline with continuous sea views. Near Ma’agan Michael, the route briefly turns east (about 100 meters) to skirt the fish ponds, then returns to the beach after a few hundred meters and continues north.\n\nAfter passing the beach by Kibbutz Nachsholim, the trail reaches Tel Dor. From there, it follows a dirt path along the coast to Habonim Beach. A shipwreck on the shoreline marks the end of the route. From this point, runners can turn east to connect with a dirt road leading to the village of Habonim.",
