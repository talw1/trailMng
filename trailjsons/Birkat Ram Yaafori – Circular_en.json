    "description": "The trail begins at the start of the promenade by Lake Ram, not far from the tomb of Nabi Afur on the outskirts of Masade. It combines paved roads, paths that wind through cherry and apple orchards, and stunning viewpoints overlooking Lake Ram, the Yaafuri Valley, Mount Hermon, Majdal Shams, Nimrod, Mount Ram, and more.\n\nSome sections of the trail have vehicle traffic, so it's recommended to avoid listening to music while running and to stay alert to your surroundings.\n\nThe trail is not easy and includes several steep and challenging climbs — in such cases, it's perfectly fine to switch to walking.\n\nThe trail is circular, but we refer here to the route heading south toward Lake Ram.",
